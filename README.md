# Color Correction Test Pipeline
This repository houses the Python code developed for the study, "A Reliable Color Correction Pipeline for Images from Different Controlled Environments." It includes all the scripts used for the various tests and comparisons presented in the research

## Getting Started
### Installation
To set up the project, first navigate to the `cc_test_pipeline` directory. Then, install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
The Python files prefixed with numbers (like `1.0_final_pipeline.py`) correspond to the different tests and analyses discussed in the study. You can open and modify these files as needed, then run them to replicate the results.

###Important:### This repository only includes sample data for demonstration purposes.
